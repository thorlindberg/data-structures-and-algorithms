/* The interface is nearly identical since both Array and Deque implement the same collection protocols. So why use a Deque over an Array? The tradeoffs are hard to see until you consider time complexity.

A Deque is a double-ended queue. Therefore, Deque optimizes for modifications from both the front and the back of the collection. Unlike Array, inserting or removing an element from the front of a Deque is a cheap O(1) operation.

In programming, everything is about tradeoffs. For Deque, itâ€™s about improving modifications in the front for the cost of slightly degraded performance on everything else. If your app requires frequent modifications to the front of a collection, a Deque will perform much better than an Array. */
