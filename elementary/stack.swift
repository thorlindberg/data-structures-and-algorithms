/* There are only two essential operations for a stack:
- push: Adding an element to the top of the stack.
- pop: Removing the top element of the stack.

In computer science, a stack is known as a LIFO (last-in-first-out) data structure. Elements that are pushed in last are the first ones to be popped out.

Memory allocation uses stacks at the architectural level. Memory for local variables is also managed using a stack.

Key points:

A stack is a LIFO, last-in first-out, data structure.
Despite being so simple, the stack is a key data structure for many problems.
The only two essential operations for the stack are the push method for adding elements and the pop method for removing elements. */

/* A stackâ€™s purpose is to limit the number of ways to access your data. Adopting protocols such as Collection would go against this goal by exposing all the elements via iterators and the subscript. In this case, less is more! */

/* You might want to take an existing array and convert it to a stack to guarantee the access order. Of course it would be possible to loop through the array elements and push each element.

However, since you can write an initializer that sets the underlying private storage. Add the following to your stack implementation: */
